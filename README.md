# Project Naturalis Q42

## üìã The concept

Hi! Welcome to our repository for the website we made during the five week project at the end of our theme semester Information Design! Here you can find the website we produced during this project.

We were tasked by [Q42](https://www.q42.nl/)to create an interactive data visualization that could display GBIF data. Q42 had already created an interactive map on which a user could find objects from the collection of Naturalis or the Natuurhistorisch Museum Rotterdam. The problem was that many of the objects in these collections did not have any geolocation data which meant that they could not be displayed on the map. We were tasked with designing an alternative view to the map which could display all objects from the collections.

We eventually decided to create a multi layered bubble chart based on the taxonomic rank of the objects. With the help of our prototype a user can dive through the taxonomic ranks to find the objects of the collections.
